<h1>Stockholm</h1>
<p>Here is a little party that I wish I was at right at this lil moment. The cool thing about Sweden is its cool lil way of including nature even in its biggest cities like stockholm!!! Since of the whole city of stockholm is made up of islands, this lil party could have taken place on a dock in a residential neighborhood overlooking another island where nothing has been built. I suggest u all go. </p>
